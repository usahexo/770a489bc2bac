        <h1 id="You-could-pocket-up-to-11-000-without-paying-taxes-on-your-winnings"><a href="#You-could-pocket-up-to-11-000-without-paying-taxes-on-your-winnings" class="headerlink" title="You could pocket up to $11,000 without paying taxes on your winnings!"></a>You could pocket up to $11,000 without paying taxes on your winnings!</h1><p>You’ve just hit the jackpot! You can now take home $11,000 tax-free.</p>
<p>That’s right – your winnings are considered “gambling income” and are not taxable.</p>
<p>There are a few things to keep in mind, though:</p>
<p>First, you must report your winnings on your tax return. This is mandatory whether or not you receive a Form W-2G (the form used to report gambling winnings).</p>
<p>Second, even though the winnings are tax-free, you may still have to pay income taxes on any money you put into the gambling venture. For instance, if you won $1,000 but only put in $100 of your own money, you would owe taxes on the $100 profit.</p>
<p>Third, gambling losses can be used to offset gambling income. This could come in handy if you had a bad night at the casino! Just be sure to keep track of your losses so you can accurately report them on your tax return.</p>
<p>Fourth, if you are lucky enough to win more than $5,000 in a year from gambling, the IRS will want to know about it. In this case, you will likely receive a Form W-2G and will be required to report the full amount of your winnings on your return.</p>
<p>Finally, if you happen to live in a state that charges income taxes on gambling winnings, those taxes will still apply. However, the federal government will not ask for its share!</p>
<p>So go ahead and enjoy those winning moments – they won’t cost you a penny in taxes!</p>
<h1 id="Find-out-how-much-tax-free-cash-you-could-take-home-from-the-races"><a href="#Find-out-how-much-tax-free-cash-you-could-take-home-from-the-races" class="headerlink" title="Find out how much tax-free cash you could take home from the races!"></a>Find out how much tax-free cash you could take home from the races!</h1><p>The excitement of horse racing is hard to beat, and there’s no better place to experience it than at one of the many races that take place all over the country. But if you’re planning on making a day of it, you need to know how much tax-free cash you could take home from the races!</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of what you can expect: </p>
<p>If you’re going to a race meeting that lasts for one day or less, and your winnings are below £500, then all of your winnings are tax-free. </p>
<p>However, if your race meeting lasts for more than one day, or your winnings are above £500, then only the first £500 of your winnings are tax-free. Anything over this amount will be subject to income tax at the prevailing rate. </p>
<p>So, if you’re heading to the races and fancy making a bit of a profit, make sure you do so within the first £500 of your winnings – anything above this amount will be taxed!</p>

Check out the list below for some tips on how to make some extra money without having to worry about Uncle Sam taking a cut.</p>
<p>#1: Offer your services as a pet-sitter</p>
<p>If you love animals, one of the best ways to make some extra cash is by offering your services as a pet-sitter. Pet-sitting is a great way to make money on the side, and there’s usually no shortage of people looking for someone to take care of their pets while they’re away. To maximize your earnings, consider signing up with a pet-sitting service like Rover.com.</p>
<p>#2: Sell handmade crafts online</p>
<p>If you have a knack for crafts, why not sell your creations online? Sites like Etsy make it easy for artists and crafters to sell their work online, and you can often charge premium prices for your handmade goods. Just be sure to research what others are charging for similar items before setting your prices.</p>
<p>#3: Write articles or blog posts for pay</p>
<p>If you’re an experienced writer, there are plenty of opportunities to make money by writing articles or blog posts for pay. A quick Google search will reveal dozens of sites that are willing to pay writers for original content, so start browsing and see if any of them fit your skills and interests.</p>
<p>#4: Tutor students in your area of expertise</p>
<p>Do you have expertise in a particular subject area? If so, why not offer tutoring services? Tutoring can be a great way to make money on the side, and there’s always demand for qualified tutors. To find clients, post ads online or contact local schools and colleges in your area.</p>
<h1 id="How-much-gambling-money-can-you-keep-without-giving-Uncle-Sam-his-share"><a href="#How-much-gambling-money-can-you-keep-without-giving-Uncle-Sam-his-share" class="headerlink" title="How much gambling money can you keep without giving Uncle Sam his share?"></a>How much gambling money can you keep without giving Uncle Sam his share?</h1><p>When it comes to gambling, the government gets its share - no matter how much you may try to keep from it. But just how much of your winnings are taxable?</p>
<p>Gambling Winnings and Taxes</p>
<p>The good news is that only a portion of your gambling winnings are subject to taxes. The bad news is that you still have to pay taxes on your winnings, even if you lose money gambling.</p>
<p>The amount of gambling money you can keep without giving Uncle Sam his share depends on the type of gambling you do. Here’s a breakdown:</p>
<p>Slot machines and other casino games: Gambling income from slot machines and other casino games is subject to a flat 25% tax rate. This means that regardless of how much money you win or lose, 25% of your winnings will go to the IRS.</p>
<p>Racing: Winnings from horse racing and dog racing are subject to a flat 30% tax rate.</p>
<p>Lotteries and raffles: Gambling income from lotteries and raffles is also subject to a flat 25% tax rate. This applies whether you win or lose money gambling in this way.</p>
<p>Poker: Winnings from poker are subject to ordinary income tax rates. This means that the amount you pay in taxes will depend on how much money you win (and lose). For example, if you’re in the 25% tax bracket, then any poker winnings over $3,900 will be taxed at that rate. However, if you’re in the 10% tax bracket, then any poker winnings over $390 will be taxed at that rate. In addition, any losses incurred while playing poker can be used to offset any taxable income earned during the year. This effectively reduces the amount of taxes owed on your gambling income.</p>
<p>What qualifies as gambling income?</p>
<p>In general, any income from gambling activities qualifies as taxable gambling income. This includes cash or prizes won while playing casino games, betting on races, playing poker, lottery tickets, and raffles. It also includes any “off-the-cuff” wagers made with friends - even if there’s no official record of the bet. On the other hand, buying tickets for lotteries or raffles doesn’t qualify as gambling income - although proceeds from selling those tickets would count as taxable income.</p>
<h1 id="Not-paying-taxes-on-your-horse-track-winnings-It’s-possible-here’s-how"><a href="#Not-paying-taxes-on-your-horse-track-winnings-It’s-possible-here’s-how" class="headerlink" title="Not paying taxes on your horse track winnings? It’s possible - here’s how!"></a>Not paying taxes on your horse track winnings? It’s possible - here’s how!</h1><p>Americans who hit it big playing the ponies might be in for a surprise when they try to cash in their winnings. Many people don’t realize that gambling income is taxable, and this includes horse track winnings.</p>
<p>Fortunately, if you do your homework and take advantage of some of the tax breaks available to you, you may not have to pay taxes on your winnings at all. Here’s what you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>While all gambling income is taxable, there are a few exceptions. Gambling losses can be used to offset gambling income, for example.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Winnings from slot machines, lotteries, and other games of chance are all considered taxable income.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Winnings from horse races, however, are often considered “miscellaneous income.” This means that they may be taxed at a different rate than other types of gambling income.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In order to avoid paying taxes on your horse track winnings, you will need to report them on IRS Form 1040 as “other income.” You will also need to include your winnings on Schedule B and indicate the amount that was withheld for federal taxes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you have any questions about how to report your gambling income, be sure to consult with a tax professional.</p>
</li>
