        <h1 id="What-is-Downtown"><a href="#What-is-Downtown" class="headerlink" title="What is Downtown?"></a>What is Downtown?</h1><p>Downtown is the most urban and populated area of a city. It is generally home to the commercial and financial center of a municipality.</p>
<p>In the United States, downtown is often synonymous with its central business district (CBD), which is the historic and economic heart of a city. The CBD is typically bound by two or more concentric rings of arterial roads, formed by the city’s freeway system.</p>
<p>Downtown is also home to many cultural and entertainment venues, such as theaters and stadiums, as well as government buildings and public institutions. Downtown may also contain expensive real estate properties, such as skyscrapers and high-end retail establishments.</p>
<h1 id="History-of-Downtown"><a href="#History-of-Downtown" class="headerlink" title="History of Downtown"></a>History of Downtown</h1><p>The first instances of downtowns in America were those founded along the East Coast by European colonists in the 17th century. In New England, coastal towns like Boston, Providence, Newport, and Salem were all established with tight concentrations of buildings at their centers. These early downtowns were typically focused on maritime activities like fishing, whaling, and shipping.</p>
<p>As the nation expanded westward in the 19th century, so too did downtowns. Traditionally Midwestern cities like Cincinnati, Cleveland, Detroit, Kansas City, Milwaukee, St. Louis, and Chicago all developed bustling commercial cores where goods and services were traded. These areas were sometimes called “the loop” because they were generally located on or near a looping stretch of railroads.</p>
<p>Following World War II, suburbanization began to take hold in America as families left cities for newly built homes in outlying areas. This led to a decline in downtown populations and businesses as people moved away from city centers. However, beginning in the 1990s there was a renewed interest in downtown living and revitalization efforts began taking place in many American cities. As a result, downtowns are now experiencing something of a resurgence nationwide.</p>
