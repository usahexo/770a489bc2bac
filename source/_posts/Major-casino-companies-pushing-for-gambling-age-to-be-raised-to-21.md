#  Major casino companies pushing for gambling age to be raised to 21

The major casino companies in the United States are pushing for the gambling age to be raised to 21. The hope is that this will help to prevent problem gambling and addiction.

The casino companies have been working with lawmakers to try and get this change passed. They feel that the current age of 18 leads to many people starting to gamble before they are ready, which can lead to problems down the road.

Lawmakers are currently considering a number of different bills that would raise the gambling age. One of the most popular proposals would see the age raised to 21 in states that currently allow gambling at 18.

There is some resistance to raising the age, however, as some people argue that it would push gambling underground and make it more difficult for law enforcement to track down illegal operations.

#  When will the gambling age be increased to 21?

There is a lot of debate surrounding when the gambling age should be increased to 21. Some people believe that this will help to reduce the number of problem gamblers, while others believe that it will just push underage gambling underground. So, what are the arguments for and against increasing the gambling age?

One argument for increasing the gambling age is that it will help to reduce the number of problem gamblers. This is because, at 21, people are legally considered adults and are more likely to understand the risks involved in gambling. They are also more likely to have the money to gamble with, which can lead to problems if they lose it.

Another argument for increasing the gambling age is that it will help to protect children and young people from developing a addiction to gambling. Children and young people are more vulnerable to developing an addiction than adults, so it is important to protect them from possible harm.

An argument against increasing the gambling age is that it will push underage gambling underground. This could lead to youngsters getting involved in illegal activities in order to access online casinos or bookmakers. It could also lead to an increase in Problem Gambling rates, as youngsters will be less likely to seek help if they are caught gambling illegally.

#  Casinos making a push for the gambling age to be raised to 21

Casinos are pushing to have the gambling age raised to 21 in order to help protect their business.

The casino industry is worth an estimated $240 billion and employs over 2 million people. Casinos are in competition with one another for market share, and they feel that raising the gambling age will help them stay ahead of the competition.

There are currently 18 states that allow gambling at 18, and casinos would like this number to be reduced to none.

Opponents of a higher gambling age argue that it will only push gambling underground, where it will be less regulated. They also argue that young adults have the right to make their own decisions.

The battle over whether or not to raise the gambling age is heating up, and it is likely that we will see more states raise the age in the coming years.

#  Is the gambling age going to be increased to 21?

The gambling age is set to be increased to 21 in the US, following the footsteps of countries such as South Korea and Australia. The move is an attempt to protect young people from the dangers of gambling, and follows a spate of high-profile cases where young people have lost large sums of money betting online.

Critics argue that the change will do little to deter young people from gambling, as they can simply cross the border into neighbouring states with looser restrictions. Others argue that it’s simply not realistic to expect young adults to wait until they are 21 years old before being allowed to gamble.

Whichever side you take, it’s clear that the debate around gambling age is far from over. So what can we expect in the coming months and years?

One possibility is that we could see more casinos popping up in border towns, as operators try to attract gamblers from other states. There is also likely to be a lot of lobbying from both sides of the argument, as lawmakers battle it out over who gets to decide on the change.

Whatever happens, it’s clear that gambling is a controversial topic – and one that isn’t going away any time soon.

#  When is the gambling age going to be raised to 21?

There is a lot of talk about whether or not the gambling age should be raised to 21, but very few people seem to actually know when this is going to happen. The good news is that it looks like the change is going to happen sooner rather than later.

One of the main reasons for this change is the fact that young people are getting addicted to gambling at an alarming rate. This can have serious consequences for their lives, and it’s important that steps are taken to prevent this from happening.

The change in the gambling age has been on the cards for some time now, and it seems that it is only a matter of time before it is finally implemented. There has been a lot of debate over the issue, but most people seem to agree that it is something that needs to be done.

21 is the legal age for drinking and smoking in most parts of the world, so it only makes sense that it would also be the legal age for gambling. This will help to protect young people from becoming addicted to gambling, and it will also help to keep them safe.

It’s important to note that there are many different types of gambling, and not all of them are suitable for people under the age of 21. Online casinos, for example, may not be suitable for young people, as they can be prone to addiction. Land-based casinos, on the other hand, may be a safer option for young people.

There have been some concerns that raising the gambling age will have a negative effect on tourism in Las Vegas and other gaming destinations, but this does not seem to be the case. In fact, many people believe that raising the age limit will have a positive effect on these destinations.

It has already been announced that the change in the gambling age will take place in 2021, so there is still plenty of time for people to get used to the idea. There are sure to be some challenges associated with this change, but it is ultimately something that needs to be done in order to protect young people from becoming addicted gambler
