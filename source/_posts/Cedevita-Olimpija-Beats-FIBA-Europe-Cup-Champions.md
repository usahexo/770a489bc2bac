#  Cedevita Olimpija Beats FIBA Europe Cup Champions

The FIBA Europe Cup champions, Khimki Moscow Region, went down to the Croatian club Cedevita Olimpija 77-72 in the last 16 of the Eurocup competition on Wednesday.

It was always going to be a tough ask for Khimki, who defeated eight other teams to win Europe's second-tier continental competition in May, against last season's Adriatic League runners-up Cedevita.

The home side led by as many as 16 points in the first half but Khimki fought back and closed the gap to just two points early in the fourth quarter. However, they could not complete the comeback and bowed out of the tournament.

American guard Lamar Patterson led all scorers with 22 points for Cedevita, with Janis Strelnieks adding 18 points. For Khimki, Tyler Honeycutt led the way with 20 points while Aaron Jackson scored 17.

Cedevita Olimpija recorded an important 92-86 victory over Buducnost VOLI in the final game of the regular season to clinch a playoff berth. The hosts were led by Pero Antic with 20 points on 8-of-11 shooting, while Ed Davis added 15 points and 13 rebounds.

The visitors had a chance to force overtime in the closing seconds, but Bojan Dubljevic's jumper rimmed out and left them empty-handed. Dubljevic led Buducnost VOLI with 22 points, followed by Nemanja Nedovic with 16.

#  Cedevita Olimpija Surges Past Igokea In NB League Action

Cedevita Olimpija surged past Igokea in a 95-79 victory on Wednesday night in the Adriatic League. Six players scored in double figures for Cedevita, led by Dario Saricâ€™s 19 points. The win pulls Cedevita to within two games of first-place Crvena zvezda mts, who lost earlier in the day.

Igokea played valiantly in the contest, but was outmatched by the more experienced and talented Cedevita squad. Damir Mrsic led Igokea with 19 points, while Marko Simonovic contributed 16.

The visitors took an early lead and never looked back, thanks in part to a stifling defense that limited Igokea to just 37 percent shooting from the field. Cedevita also out-rebounded Igokea 46-32, including 23 offensive rebounds that led to 22 second-chance points.

Cedevita will look to continue its winning ways on Friday when it hosts KK Cibona.
