#  Seattle Mariners announce plans for state-wide sports betting

The Seattle Mariners have announed plans to partner with a state-wide sports betting company in order to offer betting services for all 30 of their games. The move is seen as a way to increase revenue for the team, and comes as other professional sports teams across the country are also looking into ways to get involved in the rapidly-growing sports betting industry.

"This is a great opportunity for us," said Mariners COO Jeff Smulyan. "We believe that sports betting can not only help us generate additional revenue, but it can also help us attract new fans to our games."

While details about the partnership are still being finalized, it is expected that fans will be able to bet on all aspects of each game, including which players will score the most points, which team will win, and even how many strikeouts a pitcher will record.

"Our goal is to create a one-stop shop for Mariners fans who want to bet on our games," said Smulyan. "We want to make it easy and convenient for them to place bets, and we believe this partnership will do just that."

The Mariners aren't the only team getting involved in sports betting; teams across the NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL are all exploring partnerships with gambling companies as they look for new ways to generate revenue. In fact, several states have already legalized sports betting, with more expected to follow in the coming years.

For now, it remains to be seen how well these partnerships will work out for team owners. But if past experience is any indication, it's likely that we'll be seeing a lot more of this in the years ahead.

#  Washington becomes first state to offer legal sports betting on Seattle Mariners games

Washington has become the first state to offer legal sports betting on Seattle Mariners games, with the state's lottery announcing that it will offer a new game called " Mariners Baseball " starting on Tuesday.

The game will allow bettors to wager on whether the Mariners will win or lose their next game, with payouts based on the final score.

Lottery Director Jim Buss said that he expects the game to be popular with fans of the team, and that the lottery is "excited to offer this new product."

This is not the first time that Washington has offered legal sports betting, as the state has been offering betting on NFL games since 1992. However, this is the first time that betting will be available on a team from outside of Nevada.

Bettors in Washington can already place bets on sports through online gambling sites and through tribal casinos, but Tuesday's announcement marks the first time that a state-run lottery will offer legal sports betting.

#  Oregon and Idaho could follow Washington's lead in legalizing sports betting on the Seattle Mariners

Oregon and Idaho could soon legalize sports betting on the Seattle Mariners, following Washington's lead.

Washington became the first U.S. state to allow widespread legal sports betting on Monday, just in time for the start of the Major League Baseball (MLB) season. The new law allows people in the state to place bets on games through licensed casinos, tribal gaming facilities, and online sportsbooks.

Oregon and Idaho are now likely to follow suit and legalize sports betting on the Mariners, as they both have large populations of MLB fans. In fact, Oregon already has a number of legalized gambling options, including tribal casinos, card rooms, and horseracing.

Legalizing sports betting on the Mariners is a major victory for fans in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. It will give them a chance to bet on their favorite team and hopefully increase their chances of winning some money.

#  Sports betting expands to new states, but not without controversy

For decades, sports betting was only legal in Nevada. But in May 2018, the US Supreme Court overturned a 26-year-old law that banned sports betting outside of Nevada. This led to a flurry of activity as states rushed to legalize sports betting in order to capture a piece of what is estimated to be a $150-billion industry.

But not everyone is happy about this development. Some argue that sports betting is morally wrong and that it will lead to more gambling addiction and other social problems. Others believe that the state should get a cut of the action, as they do with casinos and lotteries.

The first state to legalize sports betting after the Supreme Court decision was Delaware. The state's lottery director, Vernon Kirk, said that he was "excited" to offer sports betting and that it would be "a major new attraction for our customers." Delaware plans to offer both bettors and bookmakers a variety of bets on professional and college sports games.

New Jersey was close behind Delaware, legalizing sports betting just one week later. New Jersey has been battling for years to legalize sports betting, as Atlantic City casinos have been struggling in the face of competition from neighboring states. The state's governor, Phil Murphy, said that the legalization of sports betting was "a great victory for Atlantic City." He added that the money raised from taxes on sports betting would go towards funding schools and pension payments.

Other states are also moving quickly to legalize sports betting. West Virginia became the third state when its senate passed a bill legalizing it on June 5th. The bill still needs approval from the House of Delegates and the governor, but it is expected to pass. Other states that have either legalized or are in the process of legalizing sports betting include Mississippi, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, and New York.

Even though several states have legalized sports betting, there is still some controversy surrounding it. The NCAA has stated that it will not allow sporting events to be held in states where sports betting is legal. This could hurt New Jersey's plans for an entertainment complex at Atlantic City's Meadowlands Racetrack that would include a hotel, restaurants, and a casino.

Despite the controversy, it appears thatsports betting is here to stay. And with many states looking to legalize it, there is sure to be plenty of action on the sidelines (and in the casinos) for years to come

#  Legalizing sports betting boosts tourism, income for states with professional sports teams

A recent study found that legalizing sports betting in states with professional sports teams would provide a significant boost to tourism and income.

The report, conducted by the Oxford Economics research firm, looked at eight states that have NFL, NBA, MLB, or NHL teams – Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, and New Jersey.

Oxford Economics found that legalizing sports betting in these states would lead to a combined increase of $2.3 billion in tourism spending and generate nearly 24,000 new jobs. In addition, income generated by taxes on gambling would bring in an additional $265 million annually.

“This study provides convincing evidence that sports betting can be a major boon to state economies and tax revenues,” said NEIL WEINBERG, one of the authors of the report.

One state that has seen this firsthand is Nevada. Since legalizing sports betting in 1979, the state has raked in more than $10.3 billion in revenue from wagers – a significant chunk of which has gone to support its Education Trust Fund.

Other states are beginning to realize the potential benefits of legalized sports betting as well. In January 2018, New Jersey became the first state to successfully challenge the federal ban on sports betting and opened its doors to legal wagers. The state is expected to rake in over $1 billion in revenue over the next 10 years as a result.

Looking ahead, it’s likely that more states will follow suit and legalize sports betting. This would not only provide a significant boost to tourism and income but would also create jobs and support education funding initiatives.
