If you are new to playing online casino games, you may be asking, "How does the slot machine percentage payout work on Fun88?" This article will cover everything you need to know.

## What Is Slot Machine Percentage Payout?

Every slot machine on Fun88 has a payout percentage or payout rate that determines how much money you can expect to be paid back. Payout percentages are usually represented in a percentage. For example, if a slot machine has a 95% payout percentage, you can expect it to pay back $95 for every $100 that you wagered.

## How Is Slot Machine Percentage Payout Determined?

The payout percentage of a slot machine is determined by the random number generator (RNG) software that the online casino uses. This software is designed to generate random numbers that determine the outcome of each spin. The payout percentage is based on the probability of a winning combination occurring.

Fun88 uses verified and audited RNG software to ensure that all its slot machines are fair and random. The payout percentage of each slot machine on Fun88 is set by the software provider that created the game.

## Why Is Slot Machine Percentage Payout Important?

The payout percentage of a slot machine is important because it determines your chances of winning. A higher payout percentage means that you are more likely to get a return on your investment. However, it is important to note that the payout percentage does not guarantee that you will win on every spin. The percentage only indicates the average amount of money that you can expect to be paid back over time.
