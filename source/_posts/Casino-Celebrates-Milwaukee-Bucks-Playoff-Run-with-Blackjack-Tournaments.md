#  Enter to Win a Free Trip to Las Vegas While Playing Blackjack at the Casino

Casino gaming is a popular pastime for people all over the world. Some enjoy the thrill of the slots, others love the strategy of poker, but one game that has always been a fan favorite is blackjack. And what could be better than combining your love of blackjack with a trip to Las Vegas?

Many casinos now offer free trips or other rewards to players who achieve a high ranking on their blackjack leaderboard. So how do you go about getting on that leaderboard and winning yourself a free trip to Vegas?

The first step is to find a casino that offers this type of promotion. A quick Google search will bring up plenty of options, but be sure to read the terms and conditions carefully before signing up. Some casinos require you to make a minimum deposit or play through a certain amount before you’re eligible for the prize.

Once you’ve found a casino that’s right for you, it’s time to start playing! Blackjack is a relatively easy game to learn, but if you need some help there are plenty of online tutorials available. The basic rules are as follows:

-You are dealt two cards and the dealer gets one card face-up and one card face-down
-Your goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over (called “busting”)
-Aces are worth 1 or 11, 2 through 10 are worth face value, and any other card (J,Q,K) is worth 10

If both you and the dealer have 21 after the first two cards are dealt (a “blackjack”), then nobody wins and it’s considered a tie. In most cases, if either you or the dealer have more than 21 after the first two cards are dealt, then that player loses automatically.

Once you understand the basic rules, it’s time to start playing! The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over; an Ace can be counted as 1 or 11 depending on what makes sense for your hand. If you want to get really serious about your blackjack strategy, there are plenty of books and websites out there that can help teach you all about counting cards and making wise decisions while playing. But even if you don’t want to get into all that, just following these simple tips should help improve your chances:

-Always split 8s and Aces
-Never split 5s or 10s
-Stand on 17 or higher; hit on 16 or lower
-Double down if your hand is 11 or 12

#  Play Blackjack and Help Support the Milwaukee Bucks

Are you a fan of the Milwaukee Bucks? Do you also like to play blackjack? If so, we have some great news for you! Starting on November 1st, the MGM Grand in Milwaukee will start offering a blackjack game called “Bucks Blackjack”. The game is designed to help support the team, with a portion of the proceeds going towards the Milwaukee Bucks Foundation.

So what is Bucks Blackjack? Basically, it’s just like regular blackjack, but there are a few added bonus features that give players a chance to win extra money. One such bonus is the “Buck Attack”. This occurs when the player gets two of the same cards (e.g. two Kings). In this case, they can choose to either double their bet or take an extra card. If they hit and get another King, they’ll win 4x their original bet!

There are also other bonus features that can help players win big payouts. For example, if you get three of a kind (e.g. three Queens), you could win up to 100x your original bet! So not only will you be rooting for the Bucks while playing this game, but you could also walk away with some serious winnings.

If you’re interested in giving Bucks Blackjack a try, we recommend making a trip to the MGM Grand in Milwaukee. The casino is located just down the street from Fiserv Forum (the home of the Milwaukee Bucks) and offers a variety of games, dining options, and live entertainment. So why not make a day or night out of it and enjoy everything the MGM Grand has to offer?
