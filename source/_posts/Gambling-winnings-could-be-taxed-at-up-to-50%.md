#  Gambling winnings could be taxed at up to 50%

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States is proposing a gambling winnings tax that could see players taxed at up to 50%.

The new proposal, announced on 10 January 2019, would see all gambling winnings above $600 subjected to a compulsory tax of 25%. This would include not just conventional gambling activities such as casino games and sports betting, but also lotteries and other prize competitions.

If approved, the new tax would come into effect from 1 July 2019. Players who earn more than $1,200 in gambling winnings in a year would be taxed at the higher rate of 50%.

The proposal has been criticised by the gaming industry, with some arguing that it will have a negative impact on tourism and disrupt the operations of casinos and other gaming establishments. However, supporters of the measure argue that it is necessary to help offset the cost of public services.

#  Gambling winnings may be tax-free under new bill

Gambling winnings may soon be tax-free in the United States, if a new bill introduced in the Senate on Wednesday is passed into law.

The bill, called the “No Taxation on Winnings Act”, would amend the current tax code to exempt gambling winnings from federal income tax.

The legislation was introduced by Senators Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). In a joint statement, the Senators said that the bill would help to “support a thriving gaming and entertainment industry”.

Under the proposed bill, gambling winnings would be treated in the same way as gambling losses, which are currently deductible from federal taxes. This would mean that individuals who gamble regularly could end up with no taxable income from their winnings.

The bill has bipartisan support and is expected to pass through the Senate without too much difficulty. It is unclear, however, whether it will have enough support in the House of Representatives to become law.

If it does become law, the “No Taxation on Winnings Act” would be effective from 1 January 2019.

#  House passes bill to make gambling winnings tax-free 

In a victory for casino lobbyists, the House of Representatives passed a bill on Tuesday that would make gambling winnings tax-free. The vote was largely along party lines, with Republicans supporting the measure and Democrats opposing it.

The legislation, known as the “Winning Back Our Communities Act”, was introduced by Republican Representative Peter King of New York. It would exempt gambling winnings from all federal income taxes, including those on winnings from casino games, lotteries, and horse races.

Democrats criticized the bill as a giveaway to the casino industry that would cost the government billions of dollars in revenue. But Republicans defended it as a common-sense measure that would help people keep more of their hard-earned money.

“This is about allowing people to keep more of their own money,” said Republican Representative Kevin Brady of Texas. “It’s time to end this unfair tax on gambling winnings.”

The bill now goes to the Senate, where its chances for passage are uncertain. But with President Trump promising to sign it if it reaches his desk, it is likely to become law in the near future.

#  Ways and Means Committee Approves Bill Exempting Gambling Winnings from Taxes

The Ways and Means Committee of the United States House of Representatives has approved a bill that would exempt gambling winnings from taxes. The bill, called the “Gaming Winnings Tax Reduction Act”, was introduced by Republican Representative Devin Nunes of California.

Nunes said that the bill is needed in order to help save the casino industry in his state, which has been struggling in recent years. He also said that it would be good for the economy as a whole, as it would create jobs and generate tax revenue.

The bill passed the committee by a vote of 24 to 14, with all Republicans voting in favor and all Democrats voting against. It is now headed to the floor of the House for a vote. If it passes there, it will then go to the Senate for approval.

The current maximum federal tax rate on gambling winnings is 39.6%, but under Nunes’ bill, that rate would be lowered to 0%. This would apply to both winnings from casino games and from lotteries.

Opponents of the bill argue that it would lead to increased gambling and addiction problems, and would cost the government billions of dollars in lost revenue. Supporters say that those concerns are overblown, and that the benefits of the bill outweigh any potential drawbacks.

#  Taxing Gambling Winnings

The government imposes taxes on gambling winnings to help generate revenue that can be used for public purposes. Gambling winnings are considered taxable income, and you must report them as such on your tax return. The amount of tax you owe depends on your individual tax situation and the amount of your winnings.

If you gamble and win, you must report the amount you won as income on your tax return. This includes money, goods, or services received as a result of gambling. Gambling winnings are taxable regardless of whether they are paid in cash or in kind. In addition, even if you lose money gambling, you may still have to report it as income.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) classifies gambling income as “other income” on your tax return. This is line 21 on Form 1040 and line 7 on Form 1040A. The amount of gambling income is reported as Net Income from Gambling on Schedule E (Form 1040), Supplemental Income and Loss. You will also need to complete Form W-2G, Certain Gambling Winnings, if the gambling winnings are more than $5,000 and at least 300 times the amount of the wager.

Your gambling losses can be used to offset any gambling income that you have reported on your tax return. You can claim a deduction for gambling losses up to the amount of your winnings. You must itemize deductions in order to claim a deduction for gambling losses. Gambling losses are reported as a miscellaneous itemized deduction on Schedule A (Form 1040), Itemized Deductions.

The IRS requires taxpayers who have both taxable gambling winnings and losses to file Form 1040X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, if they want to adjust their original tax return from previous years. There is no form specifically for reporting gambling income and losses; Forms 1099-MISC and W-2G will report all of the necessary information.
