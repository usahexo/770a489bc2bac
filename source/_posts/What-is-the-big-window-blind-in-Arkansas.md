#  Biggest window blind in poker Arkansas finally identified

The big blind in poker is a position on the poker table that is immediately to the left of the small blind. The big blind is also the first player to act after the flop. The position derives its name from the size of the bet that is made by the player in this spot.

In most poker games, the big blind is typically equal to twice the size of the small blind. For example, in a game with a $1 small blind and a $2 big blind, the big blind would be $4. In some games, such as no-limit Texas hold'em, the size of the big blind can vary depending on the betting limits.

The player to the left of the big blind is in what's called "the cut-off." The cut-off is in a very good position because they get to see what everyone else before them has done before they are forced to act.

The next two players are in "the button" and "the hijack," respectively. These positions are not as desirable as the cut-off because they each have to act after one more player (compared to being in cut-off). This means that there's a greater chance that they'll have to make a move when there may not be any good moves available.
