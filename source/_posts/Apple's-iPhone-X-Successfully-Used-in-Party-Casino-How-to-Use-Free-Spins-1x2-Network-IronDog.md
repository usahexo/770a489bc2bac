iPhone X, Apple's latest and most expensive smartphone yet, made headlines when it was released in November 2017. The phone's design, featuring a nearly all-screen display and facial recognition technology, was highly anticipated. And the iPhone X did not disappoint; it was named the best smartphone of 2017 by several reviewers.

Since its release, the iPhone X has been used in a number of interesting ways. In March 2018, for example, an American man used his iPhone X to successfully gamble at an online casino.

The man, who goes by the name of "IronDog", used his iPhone X to play party casino games such as blackjack and roulette. He also used the phone to make deposits and withdrawals from his party casino account.

IronDog's winnings totaled $5,000 - a testament to the iPhone X's power and reliability as a gambling device.
